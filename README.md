This is the Android application for the School and is my first android application. I am very new to programming in general and 
more new to java. I am having a fun time with it so far. if anyone comes across this you can comment whatever you would like
you can also use any of the code you would like. I have implemented a few fun API's that allow for google maps and Jsoup for
HTML parsing. Enjoy!
